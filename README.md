# Nine-Tails-Game

Nine Tails problem. 
Nine coins are placed in a 3x3 matrix with some face up and some face down. A legal move is to take a coin that is faced up and reverse it, together with the coin adjacent to it. 
The Nine tail problem can be reduced to the shortest path problem. 

The task is to find the minimum number of moves that lead to all coins being face down. The Result should be achieved by using the shortest path possible.  
For example: 
The Final Result should look like this: 
       T T T
       T T T
       T T T
